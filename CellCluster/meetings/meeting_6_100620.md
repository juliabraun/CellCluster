# Meeting Notes
##### DATE 10/06/2020

## Last weeks progress
- wrote gauss filter function
- commentary and clean up code
- wrote a second kmeans approach

## Questions
- what does "shadows name 'x' from outer scope" mean in PyCharm?
--> naming variable confusion

## Plans for next week
- implement unit testing

## Learned
 - if __name__ == ´´__main__´´
 - docstring commenting only in function description. gives a normal string. 
 use the commenting outside of functions. 
 - write comments in init.py as comments, not als docstring
 - init.py inside a folder is for telling python that the folder is a package.
