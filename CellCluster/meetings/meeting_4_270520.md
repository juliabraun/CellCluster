# Meeting Notes
##### DATE 27/05/2020

## Last weeks progress
- wrote dice score function
- kmeans implemented, different distance functions written and tested, kmeans documentation, test function

## Questions
- we found two different ways to implement a dice score function that yield different outputs. 
We understand the differences between them, but are not completely sure which version works best in our case
--> use another formula, Nicolas will ask Leonid about it 


## Plans for next week
- preprocessing



## Learned
- file format: no spaces, correct file ending! "meeting_05_25.md" instead of "meeting 05.25.20". .py, .md. 
- true positive/true negative: agreement between control data and segmented data in 0 and 1
- false positive: 0 in control data is recognized as 1 in segmented data
- false negative: 1 in control data is recognized as 0 in segmented data. 
- indent inside definition 4 spaces
- use docstring for function documentation
