##### DATE 17/06/2020

## Last weeks progress
- startup_clustering: explains the program functionalities

## Questions
- filepath = pl.Path("C://","Users", "User", "Images", "jw-1h 3_c5.TIF")
 How to find this file independently? I.e. what does pathlib exactly do?
 How can we reference to the "Images" folder in github?
 
 --> different file structures for different computers 

 - Control image named "jw-15min 5_c5_43" is empty.
 --> discuss the empty image ! What to do with the empty image, and why we did it? 
 Explain why we removed it/did not remove it. 
 


## Plans for next week
- update all imports
- update filepath statement
- put the startup file outside kmeans --> set up filepath as specified by the repository 
- gitignore: python, jupyter, visual studio, Jetbrains
- branch: everyone works on a different feature; commit as feature for the branch; first merge master branch in feature branch; then merge in master
- git commit; push; pull request; comment & request changes; merge; delete branch; checkout and update
- do review of pull request together with Nicolas next week !
