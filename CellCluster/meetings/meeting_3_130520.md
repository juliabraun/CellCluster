# Meeting Notes
##### DATE 13/05/2020

## Last weeks progress
- project proposal draft
- kmeans conceptual planning
- further research on filtering methods


## Questions
- resolution of timeline: in weeks, months?
- literature recommendation for kmeans clustering
- Chinese-whispers, water-shed algorithm ? 
--> Self-implementation is restricted to the core algorithm. For everything beyond can be used pre-existing function implementations. We have to explain: What does it do? Why do we use it? But no details to functions arguments etc. 
- howfar is actually sensible to separate fused nuclei? Do they biologically belong to each other, or are they separated entities? 


## Plans for next week
- conclude project proposal --> as PDF in repo
- **table or gentchart for milestones**
- **explain clustering and dicescore**
- **get further ideas from the literature**

*Important for evaluation:*  
- *implementation of kmeans, and what has been done with the results.* 
- *What is the interpretation of the different results obtained from the filters?*


## Learned
 - **unit testing, mocking**
 - **test-driven design**
 - **filter cascade, compare different Gaussian filters**
